# Running a sinatra application on Docker

This is sample project for running a sinatra application on Docker from within a Travis build.

The build also runs another container using the same Docker image and runs the sinatra applications' test suite within this container..

It was cloned from [tcnksm](https://github.com/tcnksm-sample/docker-sinatra) and modified (with thanks).
